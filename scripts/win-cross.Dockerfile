# Linux image that cross-builds the Windows NSIS installer for Toys of Dev.
# Used because the macOS arm64 Homebrew `makensis` bottle is broken (crashes with
# std::bad_alloc), while Debian's NSIS works fine. The Rust half cross-compiles
# to x86_64-pc-windows-msvc via cargo-xwin (same as on macOS).
